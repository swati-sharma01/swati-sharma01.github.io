  - description: "Originally from India, I moved to the U.S. in 2019 to get my doctoral degree. Armed with a bachelor's degree in Economics and two additional master's degrees in the same field, I am fervently engaged in studying the dynamic setup of open economy macroeconomic policies. Alongside my research pursuits, teaching is a genuine passion of mine, and I have gained valuable experience instructing undergraduate courses throughout my doctoral program. An avid reader, I find equal joy in exploring new destinations and expressing my creativity through sketching. I'm always open to new experiences, cultures, and ways of thinking."
