  - title: "Inflation Targeting: Is it still making a difference?"
    description: 
      - Abstract- With more than three decades since its first adoption, Inflation targeting (IT) has emerged as the popular monetary policy regime that has been increasingly adopted by advanced as well as emerging economies. This paper examines the impact of adopting IT on inflation using a staggered difference-in-difference approach. The estimation methodology is relevant to the multiple periods and variation in treatment timing setup. The long panel data set is divided into two sample periods, and these samples are further restricted based on certain threshold analyses. The findings suggest that IT reduces inflation for treated countries, on average, by 2.5%.
